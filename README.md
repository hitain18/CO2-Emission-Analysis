# CO2 Emission Data Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on global CO2 emission data to identify trends, country-level contributions, and relationships between emissions, energy consumption, and population growth.

##  Objectives
- Analyze CO2 emission trends over time
- Identify top emitting countries
- Study per capita emissions
- Explore correlations between variables

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

##  Key Insights
- Global CO2 emissions have significantly increased after 2000.
- CO2 emissions increased ~30% between 1990–2020.
- Country X contributed 25% of total emissions.
- Strong correlation observed between energy consumption and emissions.
- Certain countries contribute disproportionately to global emission.
